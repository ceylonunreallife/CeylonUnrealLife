# QB-Camera

A simple camera script made for the qbcore framework. Creates a usable camera item that takes picutres ingame and uploads to discord. Configurable zoom, zoom speeds and much! Made for the police on my server to document crime scenes and conduct investigations. Totally not inspired by a big city police camera script lmao

Add this into your resource folder and remember to ensure "qb-camera" in your server's CFG

Don't forget to add the webhook! It's kinda the whole point of the script, and will allow the people using the script to fully benefit from its features!

Add the provided image into where your inventory's picture folder is. Usually inside the HTML folder.

Add this into your items.lua to create the usable item.

Support will not be given for installing the script
